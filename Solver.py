# Simple Equation solver class containing methods for to solve the ODE based on input parameters
# this should honestly be written as static, must needs look further into nuance of this in python.
class Solver:

    def __init__(self):
        # unsure if anything needs initialization yet.

    '''
    Simple solution method, takes in all necessary data according to the ODE solver in sciPy,
    utilizes runge kutta methods returns data set necessary for graphing with pyplot.
    '''
    def simple_solve (self,):
        pass
        # returns data set for py plot.
    '''
    If a rigid solution method is needed this function will run and return necessary data set.
